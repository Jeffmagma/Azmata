# Style Guide
Tabs are fine for indentation  
One space after keywords like `if`
```java
if (condition)
```
One space between brace and bracket
```java
int method() {
```
Name variables in snake_case because they're easier to read
```java
int some_variable;
```
Name constants with ALL_CAPS
```java
final int SOME_CONSTANT;
```
Name methods in camelCase
```java
void someMethod()
```
Name classes in CamelCase aswell
```java
class SomeClass
```
